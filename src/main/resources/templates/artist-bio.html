        <p> Brenda Lynn Robinson was born in Columbus in 1940. During a visit to Africa in 1979, 
          an Egyptian holy man gave her the name “Aminah” which she legally affixed to her given names. 
          For almost seven decades, she created art that she described as “filling in the blank pages 
          of American history.” She did this by depicting the lives and events of both ordinary and 
          extraordinary African Americans.</p>

          <p>Aminah, as she preferred to be called, spent the first 17 years of her life 
          in Poindexter Village, one of the country’s first federal apartment complexes 
          for African Americans. In 1974, she moved to Sunbury Road on the eastside of 
          Columbus where she remained until she passed away in 2015. She left almost 
          her entire estate to the Columbus Museum of Art. The home studio was 
          renovated and is now a residence for African American artists and writers 
          and a daily workspace for local artists. (For more information, 
          visit www.gcac.org/grants-services/individual-artist-fellowships) </p>

   <p>When Aminah was a little girl, her father taught her how to draw and how to make books from 
     homemade paper and "hogmawg," a mixture of mud, clay, twigs, leaves, lime, animal grease, 
     and glue. The artist used hogmawg in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional work. Her mother taught 
     her weaving, needlework, and button work.</p>

     <p>From a very young age, she knew she wanted to be an artist and began attending 
    the Columbus Art School (now the Columbus College of Art and Design) on Saturdays 
    while she was still in high school and then continued after she graduated from high school.</p>

    <p>Aminah created sculpture, RagGonNons, rag paintings, paintings on cloth, drawings, and books. 
    Many of them are about her family and community and about the stories she has been told by her elders. 
    She also researched the lives of abolitionists, civil rights leaders, musicians, and writers and depicts them in her art.</p>

    <p>Her art is grounded in her belief in the African concept of Sankofa, learning from the past 
    in order to move forward. She has taken extended journeys to various countries in Africa; 
    New York City; Sapelo Island, Georgia; Israel; and Chile. Each journey has resulted in a 
    series of art that often includes a RagGonNon, a large and complex work of art that is 
    often on cloth encrusted with buttons, beads, and other found objects.</p>

    <p>The artist has had her work exhibited in museums and galleries throughout the United 
    States and she has received numerous awards and grants from arts organizations. In 2002, 
    the Columbus Museum of Art organized a retrospective exhibition of her work that traveled 
    throughout the country. In 2004, Aminah was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship which is given 
    to "talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative 
    pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction."</p>

    <p>Her work is in many private collections and in many museums including the Columbus Museum of Art, 
    the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Tacoma Art Museum and the Newark Museum.</p>

                                       for the house. So I said, "I need to build a chair."
                                       I didn’t really have the materials, so my father and
                                       friends gave me scraps... It represents my family and community.
                                       That's what the chair is about—life in Columbus."
